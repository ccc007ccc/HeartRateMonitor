## FAQ

1. **Why doesn't the floating window appear in some full-screen games?**

   This is because some games use "exclusive full-screen" mode, which takes full control of the screen and prevents other applications (including this app's floating window) from being displayed on top.

   Displaying a floating window in true full-screen mode requires drawing directly into the game's rendering pipeline, which I avoided due to the risk of getting banned during testing üòì.

   **Solution:** Try changing the game's display mode from "Full Screen" or "Exclusive Full Screen" to "Borderless Window" or "Windowed Full Screen." This provides a similar visual experience while allowing the floating window to display properly.

2. **The app can't find my Bluetooth band or heart rate strap?**

   Make sure your device has enabled heart rate broadcasting and is discoverable via Bluetooth. Also ensure your computer‚Äôs Bluetooth is turned on and functioning properly.
